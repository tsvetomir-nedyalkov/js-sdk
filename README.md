# Overview

[Kinvey](http://www.kinvey.com) (pronounced Kin-vey, like convey) makes it ridiculously easy for developers to setup, use and operate a cloud backend for their mobile apps. They don't have to worry about connecting to various cloud services, setting up servers for their backend, or maintaining and scaling them.

The JS SDK is used as a way to share common code for platform specific SDK shims. Here is a list of the platforms we currently support.

* [NativeScript](https://github.com/Kinvey/nativescript-sdk)
* [Angular](https://github.com/Kinvey/angular-sdk)
* [Angular 2](https://github.com/Kinvey/angular2-sdk)
* [Backbone](https://github.com/Kinvey/backbone-sdk)
* [HTML5](src/html5)
* [NodeJS](https://github.com/Kinvey/node-sdk)
* [PhoneGap](https://github.com/Kinvey/phonegap-sdk)
* [Titanium](https://github.com/Kinvey/titanium-sdk)
