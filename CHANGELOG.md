[Full Changelog](https://github.com/Kinvey/js-sdk/compare/v3.8.0...v3.8.1)<br/>

### Added
_None_

### Removed
_None_

### Fixed
- Resolve `Kinvey.initialize()` with an instance of `Kinvey.User` or `null`.

## [3.8.0](https://github.com/Kinvey/js-sdk/tree/v3.8.0) (2017-08-23)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/Kinvey/js-sdk/compare/v3.5.2...v3.8.0)<br/>

### Added
- Log requests made by the SDK
- Allow a `micId` to be added to the `client_id` value sent for a Mobile Identity Connect request. See [#140](https://github.com/Kinvey/js-sdk/pull/140).
- Replace native node modules with npm packages. This allows us to support platforms that do not run in a Node or Web environment such as NativeScript and React Native.

### Removed/Deprecated
- Deprecated `Kinvey.initialize()`. Please use `Kinvey.init()` instead. If you use `Kinvey.init()` you might not have an active user even though you had already logged in. To fix this, use `Kinvey.initialize()` to move the active user to the correct storage. From then on you will be able to use `Kinvey.init()` and retrieve your active user. `Kinvey.init()` does not return a promise and is synchronous.

```javascript
// Will return the shared client instance
Kinvey.init({
  appKey: '<appKey>',
  appSecret: '<appSecret>'
});
```

### Fixed
- SDK shims can now override the way an active user is stored. This allows the SDK shim to use the preferred storage for that platform.
- Default to removing a user with `hard` equal to `false`.
- SDK shims can now override file uploads.
- Queries will properly be encoding.

## [3.5.0](https://github.com/Kinvey/js-sdk/tree/v3.5.0) (2017-04-20)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/Kinvey/js-sdk/compare/v3.4.5...v3.5.0)<br/>

### Added
- `usePopupClass()` as a static function to the `User` class for registering a popup class to be used for MIC authentication.
- Tests to increase code coverage to 90%.

### Removed
- `init()` static function on `Kinvey` namespace. This was deprecated with [v3.3.3](https://github.com/Kinvey/js-sdk/v3.3.3).
- `baseUrl`, `protocol`, and `host` properties on a `client` instance. These were deprecated with [v3.0.0](https://github.com/Kinvey/js-sdk/v3.0.0).
- `syncCount()` and `purge()` on `CacheStore` and `SyncStore` instances. These were deprecated with [v3.2.0](https://github.com/Kinvey/js-sdk/v3.2.0).

### Fixed
- `restore()` static function from the `User` class to throw an error whenever it is called. This function required an end user to supply their master secret for their application. We strongly advise not to do this in your application.
- All `toJSON()` functions have now been replaced by `toPlainObject()`. The returned result is the exact same.
- `save()`, `create()`, and `update()` on datastore instances no longer accepts an array of entities. This is to help with reporting errors that may occur when saving an entity.
- `remove()` and `removeById()` on datastore instances now returns the count of entities removed and not the actual entity removed.
- Results returned when pushing sync items to the backend contain a new property called `operation`. This property will either be `Kinvey.SyncOperation.Create`, `Kinvey.SyncOperation.Update`, or `Kinvey.SyncOperation.Delete`.

### Merged Pull Requests
- Increase Test Coverage [#122](https://github.com/Kinvey/js-sdk/pull/122)
- Add a function to overwrite Popup class [#124](https://github.com/Kinvey/js-sdk/pull/124)
- Cleanup [#125](https://github.com/Kinvey/js-sdk/pull/125)

```
Kinvey.initialize({
  appKey: '<appKey>',
  appSecret: '<appSecret>',
  defaultTimeout: 30000 // 30 seconds in ms
